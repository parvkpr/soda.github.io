  abstract ={Seamlessly integrating rules in Learning-from-Demonstrations (LfD) policies is a critical requirement to enable the real-world deployment of AI agents. Recently, Signal Temporal Logic (STL) has been shown to be an effective language for encoding rules as spatio-temporal constraints. This work uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) as a means of integrating STL specification into a vanilla LfD policy to improve constraint satisfaction. We propose augmenting the MCTS heuristic with STL robustness values to bias the tree search towards branches with higher constraint satisfaction. While the domain-independent method can be applied to integrate STL rules online into any pre-trained LfD algorithm, we choose goal-conditioned Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning as the offline LfD policy. We apply the proposed method to the domain of planning trajectories for General Aviation aircraft around a non-towered airfield. Results using the simulator trained on real-world data showcase 60 percent improved performance over baseline LfD methods that do not use STL heuristics.},

  title={Challenges in Close-Proximity Safe and Seamless Operation of Manned and Unmanned Aircraft in Shared Airspace},
  abstract={We propose developing an integrated system to keep autonomous unmanned aircraft safely separated and behave as expected in conjunction with manned traffic. The main goal is to achieve safe manned-unmanned vehicle teaming to improve system performance, have each (robot/human) teammate learn from each other in various aircraft operations, and reduce the manning needs of manned aircraft. The proposed system anticipates and reacts to other aircraft using natural language instructions and can serve as a co-pilot or operate entirely autonomously. We point out the main technical challenges where improvements on current state-of-the-art are needed to enable Visual Flight Rules to fully autonomous aerial operations, bringing insights to these critical areas. Furthermore, we present an interactive demonstration in a prototypical scenario with one AI pilot and one human pilot sharing the same terminal airspace, interacting with each other using language, and landing safely on the same runway. We also show a demonstration of a vision-only aircraft detection system. },

      author={Yao He and Ivan Cisneros and Nikhil Keetha and Jay Patrikar and Zelin Ye and Ian Higgins and Yaoyu Hu and Parv Kapoor and Sebastian Scherer},
      abstract={Robust and accurate localization for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is an essential capability to achieve autonomous, long-range flights. Current methods either rely heavily on GNSS, face limitations in visual-based localization due to appearance variances and stylistic dissimilarities between camera and reference imagery, or operate under the assumption of a known initial pose. In this paper, we developed a GNSS-denied localization approach for UAVs that harnesses both Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and Visual Place Recognition (VPR) using a foundation model. This paper presents a novel vision-based pipeline that works exclusively with a nadir-facing camera, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and pre-existing satellite imagery for robust, accurate localization in varied environments and conditions. Our system demonstrated average localization accuracy within a 20-meter range, with a minimum error below 1 meter, under real-world conditions marked by drastic changes in environmental appearance and with no assumption of the vehicle's initial pose. The method is proven to be effective and robust, addressing the crucial need for reliable UAV localization in GNSS-denied environments, while also being computationally efficient enough to be deployed on resource-constrained platforms.},

  title={Investigating Robustness in Cyber-Physical
Systems: Specification-Centric Analysis in the face
of System Deviations},
  abstract= {

    The adoption of cyber-physical systems (CPS) is on the rise in complex physical environments, encompassing domains such as autonomous vehicles, the Internet of Things (IoT), and smart cities. A critical attribute of CPS is robustness, denoting its capacity to operate safely despite potential disruptions and uncertainties in the operating environment. This paper proposes a novel specification-based robustness, which characterizes the effectiveness of a controller in meeting a specified system requirement, articulated through Signal Temporal Logic (STL) while accounting for possible deviations in the system. This paper also proposes the robustness falsification problem based on the definition, which involves identifying minor deviations capable of violating the specified requirement. We present an innovative two-layer simulation-based analysis framework designed to identify subtle robustness violations. To assess our methodology, we devise a series of benchmark problems wherein system parameters can be adjusted to emulate various forms of uncertainties and disturbances. Initial evaluations indicate that our falsification approach proficiently identifies robustness violations, providing valuable insights for comparing robustness between conventional and reinforcement learning (RL)-based controllers },
